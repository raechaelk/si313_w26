## Assignment Tips

### VS Code

#### Virtual Environments
Think of a _virtual environment_ as an isolated container for each of your Python projects. It ensures that the specific tools and libraries one project needs don't interfere with or break another project on your computer.

[Here's a video with info about using virtual environments in VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2cwvpJSBX4).

Best practice is to have one virtual environment for each project. If 313 assignments are the only Python you're working on, you could use your "base" Python. You used Anaconda in 201, and it is a tool for managing virtual environments. Anaconda manages environments through its own package manager called Conda.

### Google Colab

If managing local Python environments isn't working, or you just don't want to, you can also use Google Colab to complete assignments. Here's a general workflow:

1. Open colab
2. Choose File → Open notebook → GitHub → (enter this GitHub repo's address) → choose the assignment template you want to work on
3. In Colab, complete the assignment
4. Choose File → Download → Download .ipynb
5. Upload the .ipynb you downloaded to the relevant Canvas assignment and submit
